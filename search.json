Academic research on the role of digital media in shaping these processes and democracy at-large is striving. Nonetheless, our research areas and analysis potential are oftentimes restricted to the data provided by large online platforms. While getting individual-level data has been an important issue ever since, platforms have restricted data access further. Therefore, researchers have started to devise their own solutions for collecting relevant digital behavioral data in the “Post-API Age”. For democracy research in particular, it is important to link digital behavioral data with individual-level information on demographics and variables like party identification, political trust or evaluations of other societal groups. To conduct user-centered data collections, research software like web tracking browser plugins, mobile apps or data donations are being developed at various academic institutions. The workshop will bring together research groups working on new technical solutions and innovative approaches for studying digital democracy.\nRationale of the tutorial\nThis workshop will help build a community of leading research teams and researchers at different career levels. The workshop is situated at the intersection of democracy research, software development and computational social science, contributing to a joint understanding of the research needs, data gaps and identification of synergies. To create valuable research data and increase independence from platforms, the academic community needs to build sustainable research infrastructures and ultimately develop joint conceptual and measurement standards. We welcome participants with diverse disciplinary backgrounds, with interest in substantive research questions, software engineering, open-source development and open science practices, many of whom share a research interest in digital media and democracy, broadly conceived. Participants will learn about innovative approaches in collecting and analyzing digital behavioral data, the most pressing themes in research on (digital) democracy and will be able to articulate and identify joint infrastructure demands. The teams working on new methodological approaches can gather valuable feedback at the workshop, learn more about and create synergies with the work of other teams.\nProgram\nOur goal is to provide a venue in which participants will engage with the topic through various formats: presentations of experts on the field, collaborative breakouts, and plenary discussion.\nWe will have at brief input presentations followed by respective Q&A sessions where recent innovative approaches for user-centered data collections will be presented and discussed. Based on the research interests of participants, we will critically discuss the applicability of different approaches for specific research questions, the remaining blind spots of the proposed data collection approaches and how these could complement each other.\nThe tentative schedule can be found below (all times are Philadelphia local time, EDT/GMT-4).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSchedule and Program\n\n\nTime\nTopic\nSpeakers\n\n\n\n\n08:30 - 09:00\nArrival and coffee\n\n\n\n09:00 - 09:20\nWelcome and introduction\nAll participants\n\n\n09:20 - 09:50\nUser-centered data collections for research on digital democracy\nSebastian Stier, Philipp Lorenz-Spreen, Lisa Oswald\n\n\n09:50 - 10:20\nInteractive session: what data do you need for your research?\nAll participants\n\n\n10:20 - 10:40\nData donations\nZoltan Kmetty\n\n\n10:40 - 11:00\nCoffee break\n\n\n\n11:00 - 11:20\nPlatform interventions and experiments\nPhilipp Lorenz-Spreen, Lisa Oswald\n\n\n11:20 - 11:50\nCSS Infrastructures: National Internet Observatory and GESIS\nPranav Goel, Sebastian Stier\n\n\n11:50 - 12:30\nStructured discussion: what software and infrastructures does the field need?\nAll participants\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrganizers and speakers\n\n\n\nSebastian Stier\n\n\n\nBioTopic\n\n\nSebastian Stier is a Scientific Director of the department Computational Social Science at GESIS – Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences and Professor of Computational Social Science at the University of Mannheim. His substantive research focuses on the impact of digital media on societies and democratic processes. In his methodological work, Sebastian Stier investigates the quality and scientific value of digital behavioral data for social science research.\n\n\nGESIS is building infrastructures for collecting, pre-processing, analyzing and providing digital behavioral data to facilitate the application of computational social science approaches in different social science fields. The infrastructure comprises research software like a web tracking tool, an app for mobile experience sampling and the new GESIS Panel.dbd with more than 5,000 participants for the collection of linked surveys and digital behavioral data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhilipp Lorenz-Spreen\n\n\n\nBioTopic\n\n\nPhilipp Lorenz-Spreen is a research scientist at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development, where his research focuses on the complexity of self-organized online discourse and its impact on democracies worldwide. Recently, he has become interested in how the research community can foster the paradigm shift in data access for research through the DSA. He received his PhD from the TU Berlin on empirical methods and theoretical models to describe the dynamics of collective attention.\n\n\nTBD\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLisa Oswald\n\n\n\nBioTopic\n\n\nLisa Oswald is a postdoctoral researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development. After receiving her PhD in political science from the Hertie School for which she worked with web browsing histories and social media data to study public discourse in online environments, she now focuses on online field experiments and interventions. She is interested in new methods of participant recruitment and ways to examine causal mechanisms of digital media effects on political cognition and behavior.\n\n\nTBD\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDavid Lazer\n\n\n\nBioTopic\n\n\nDavid Lazer is University Distinguished Professor of Political Science and Computer and Information Science, Northeastern University, and an elected fellow to the National Academy of Public Administration. His research focuses on computational social science, social networks, democratic deliberation, algorithm auditing and collective intelligence.\n\n\nDavid Lazer is one of the PIs of the National Internet Observatory (NIO). NIO is funded by a generous grant from the National Science Foundation and aims to help researchers understand how people behave online and how online platforms structure what people see.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPranav Goel\n\n\n\nBioTopic\n\n\nPranav Goel is a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the Lazer Lab at Northeastern University’s Network Science Institute. His research interests broadly span computational social science and natural language processing, viewing language as a social phenomenon and text data as a potent digital trace of societal dynamics. He is particularly interested in the sociopolitical phenomenon of framing (including agenda-setting) in news and social media.\n\n\nPranav will present the National Internet Observatory (NIO). NIO has created a large panel of individuals whose behaviors and interactions with platforms via desktop browsers and smartphones are recorded.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZoltan Kmetty\n\n\n\nBioTopic\n\n\nZoltán Kmetty is an Associate Professor in the Sociology department at the Eötvös Loránd University Faculty of Social Sciences in Budapest, Hungary.
